Donald Trump is quite the [talker](http://time.com/4367120/orlando-shooting-donald-trump-transcript/).

>When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the U.S., Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.

Many of the recent mass killings in the U.S have been committed by home grown terrorists; people who were born and raised in the United States, but often were never able to call it a home.

The problem is not weak immigration laws, an unprotected border, or refugees, it is a culture of hate and of fear which people like Donald Trump are proliferating as a means to win the votes of the American electorate. Trump has no idea what it feels like to feel frightened and unsafe because of who he is.   He has no idea what it is like to go someplace and feel unwelcome because of an immutable fact about himself.  Not everyone is as lucky as he. Anyone who has lived as a part of a marginalized group - women, LGBTQ people, racial minorities, people living in poverty - these people have experienced things of which Donald Trump knows nothing, and for which he cares little. These are the people who know best that answering intolerance with intolerance does nothing. Unfortunately, these are also the people who historically have the most difficult time getting to the polls and voting because of the institutionalized oppression which Donald Trump proliferates.

Don't give into fearing the unknown, embrace it. Fear is what causes people to hate and to rage. \"Hate begets hate; violence begets violence; toughness begets a greater toughness. We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love.\" These insane events will continue to happen until we can change our culture of fear and hate into one of acceptance and love.
Many will use this weekend\'s murders as a means to justify hate. Islamophobia, homophobia, sexism, racism, they\'re all the same and they all need to stop.
