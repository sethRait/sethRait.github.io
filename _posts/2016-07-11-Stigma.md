# Let's Talk About Sex

[Grindr](http://www.grindr.com/), a populer gay dating and hookup app {{ (with notoriously poor reliability) }} holds an important place in the gay community.  It has 5-6 million monthly active users and 2.4 million dayly active users [(source)](http://venturebeat.com/2016/04/05/mobile-app-analytics-how-grindr-monetizes-6-million-active-users-webinar/) in 196 countries. {{ As of April, 2016 }}  That's a lot of people, a vast majority of whom are gay men.  This large userbase gives Grindr a platform to spread ideas, which it does regularly.  Grindr commonly supports urgant and developing causes through pop-up adds on the app's home screen.  [Most of the initiatives Grindr supports](http://www.grindr.com/g4e/) are in someway related to LGTBQ rights, though not exclusively.  These pop-ups generally link to reputable organizations such as the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/).  This would have me believe a cause to which Grindr would be amenable is the destigmatization of those living with HIV.

## Grindr's New Survey

Recently, Grindr has been sending out a survey to some of its active users.  I didn't recieve the survey, so I only found out about this secondhand.  The survey looks like this:

For those who didn't take the time to read, this survey is asking about whether users would appreciate a new Grindr filter, one predicated on HIV status.  The way Grindr filters work is, a user sets a preferece, be it for body type, relationship status, or other various features of a potential match, and those for whom this user's filters don't correspond are invisible to the user when his filter is applied.  For example, if I selected a filter wherin I was only interested in seeing profiles of users under the age of 99, then no user over that age would appear to me on the app.  However, a user over that age could still contact me, and as long as I met the characteristics described in his filters, my profile would show up on his feed.
