title: Technology and Privilege
---
Intersectionality is a weird thing to think about.  This is the reason people have trouble identifying their privilege, and why I myself had this problem.  On one hand, both my sexual orientation and my religion put me squarely in the minority/marginalized peoples category.  On the other, more dominant hand (my left hand), I have many distinct privileges.   I am a student at a rather prestigious university, I have disposable income, will most likely never have to worry about finding work, I am able bodied, and I am white.  This post is about realizing both my privilege and my place, and what some of my responsibilities are as a result.

## 1. Free Stuff and Networking
As a gay man living in Boston, it is very easy for me to forget that being gay isn't universally acceptable.  Rarely do I face any adversity for being gay.  In my micro-environment of Brandeis University, being gay is easier than being a Republican, a common saying here.  It could be the way I present myself (unlikely), or the people I associate with (more likely), but even heteronormativity doesn't seem to be too prevalent an issue anymore.  I know this is not the case elsewhere, which is why I have always been an active and vocal supporter of of LGBTQ rights.  However, in my personal situation, being gay actively helps me further my educational and career goals.  Here's an example.

I recently attended the Out for Undergrad Tech Conference (OUTC) for the second year in a row.  This event is a conference for LGBTQ undergrads to explore the issues related to their gender and sexual identities in the context of technology.  The conference has many generous sponsors who have given the attendees the ability to be there.  We are courted with free travel to San Francisco, a free hotel room for two nights, and dozens of free shirts, pants, books, and more.  What's more, at the end of the conference, there is a career fair with  the largest technology companies in the world.  Sound like a nice weekend?  It was.

Yet, do I deserve all this?  I may be gay, but I have had ample opportunity in my life, and this special treatment feels like cheating.  People can't tell just by looking at me that I am a minority.  Furthermore, I've had my confidence built up my whole life to the point where talking to potential employers doesn't intimidate me like it can people who weren't brought up in my circumstances.  I don't get nervous meeting new people, talking to professors, or speaking in public.  The reason events for marginalized peoples are held is so they can "level the playing field."  If the field is already on even ground for me, is it right for me to take advantage of this?  We'll return to this question later.
