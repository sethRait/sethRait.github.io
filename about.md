At age 15, I excitedly signed up for my first computer networking class. I was quickly disappointed - the class spent what seemed like an entire year learning to make cat5 network cables.  I resolved to take my education into my own hands outside the classroom.  After fishing through various resources for a few days, I settled on an online CCNA class that changed my world.  It didn't stop there- after receiving my certification, curiosity drove me to take a breadth-first approach to learning everything I could about networking.  After mastering the basics, I've spent the last few years specializing in the aspects that interested me the most (active directory, windows/unix scripting, data center/server virtualization, and file-system manipulation to name a few).
