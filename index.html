                <p>At age 15, I excitedly signed up for my first computer networking class. I was quickly dissapointed- we spent an entire year learning to make a cat5 network cable.
                    I resolved to take my education into my own hands outside the classroom. After fishing through various resources for a few days, I settled on an online CCNA class that changed
                    my world. It didn't stop there- after receiving my certification, curiosity drove me to take a breadth-first approach to learning everything I could about networking.
                    After mastering the basics, I've spent the last few years specializing in the aspects that interested me the most (active directory, windows/unix scripting, data center/server
                    virtualization, and file-system manipulation to name a few).

                <p>This passionate pursuit of networking that began outside of the classroom has now become my classroom: I'm a rising sophomore at Brandies University, where I'm studying Computer Science,
                    and I couldn't be happier. This summer I've even had the luck to combine my interests and education with employment as the Assistant Network and Security Adminstrator at the Heller
                    School of Social Policy and Management (you can read more about what I do <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/sethrait">here</a>). In my free time, I organize and run Brandies' bi-annual hackahton,

                        shoot me an email</a>- I guarantee we'll have something to talk about.</p>
